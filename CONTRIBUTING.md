This is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:

1. Search [GitHub](https://github.com/adminapp-foundation/EmailSending-dotnet/pulls) for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.

2. Fork the [repo](https://github.com/adminapp-foundation/EmailSending-dotnet) and create your branch `topic` from master.

3. Make your changes in a new git branch.

4. Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message.

5. Push your branch to GitHub forked repo.

6. In GitHub, submit a pull request to [adminapp-foundation/EmailSending-dotnet](https://github.com/adminapp-foundation/EmailSending-dotnet).

That's it! Thank you for your contribution. After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch 'topic'.
